At the beganning of this semester, our direction is using automatic drones to deliver foods, however, we had changed it in half way. We changed to a new concept that is improving the experience of both borrowers and librarians by fixing the problems they have faced and they are facing curruntly in the book borrowing and managing processes though using app to control the automatic devices. This this journal I will mention the all processes of how do I get the final prototype and the evaluation results.</p>

                <p>This is the new start point for me, I just looked at the deign brief of this semester, it was really tough, I have uncountable assessments to do. Then I went to the lecture. In this semester, I need to design an App that can allow the user use it to interact with automatic drone or vehicle. The first report is due at fourth week. I started to do some research about automatic drone and vehicle to decide to choose my main concept.</p>

                <p>All of my group had done the research, and we discussed that in this week. I research lot of news and reports, the idea I got is that we can design an APP to interact with the medical drone. It works like that, if you are feeling not good, and it is really inconvenient to go to hospital or it is really too emergency to wait the ambulance, the drone will come first to do the first-aid. However, my group members thought that it is difficult to do the research and find enough participants. So we changed our main concept to food delivery drones. I agreed that, because it actually is easier to do research. Food delivery is really popular now, I can get many information from news and report, and for the further research, it is easy to find the target participants, cause every one has the experience of using food delivery such as Domino, Foodra and Uber eats. Then I discussed this idea with my tutor, my tutor said this idea is ok, but we need to research enough information and analyze that. We also were asked to do interview with people to know their current experiences.</p>

                <p>The first report is due week 4, I was starting to writing my report. This week I actual interviewed 5 people, they are my friends who are the students and they don’t have time to cook or they not able to cook. So they order food delivery every day, interviewing them would be my best choice. However, in fact, they don’t satisfy current experience. Even for me, I still have the experience of delay delivery, and the driver’s service attitude is really bad. Depending on my and their experiences I sketched the storyboard to show the currently bad experience. The story actually also happened on me, it talks about the student orders the food delivery from App, and App shows this order will be delivered in 20 minutes. However, 35 minutes after, the order still doesn’t arrive, the student calls the driver, driver just says he will be quicker. The student is waiting for his order 1 hours, the driver eventually arrive with really bad attitude, the student feels so bad. Moreover, I also generated an online questionnaire to collect useful data, the interesting finding is that many participants have heard the delivery staff hurt users and steal things from users ‘homes. Even through that doesn’t happened in the participants, they still are afraid of that. Depending on the research and interview, I summarized several key findings. Customers want food delivery could be efficiency and on time, the delivery staff should be nice and users’ security should be secured.</p>

Actually, I noticed that recently the drone is really popular, especially in China. So I decided start the research from China. In China, the biggest online food delivery company Ele.me already using Drones to delivery foods in Shanghai. However, that is little bit different as I thought. It does not deliver your order to your home straightly, the delivery staff puts the food in the drone’s box at the start point of the drone, and the drone will deliver the box to direction nearby, and other delivery staff will open the box and deliver the foods to different users ‘positions.</p>

At the meantime, I also experienced the current borrowing process. I believe that through the observation and walkthrough, I can understand what are the actual users needs from their perspectives. In fact, I got some findings: 1. in the daily works, librarian trend to spend majority time on finding the actual position of books. Even for the students, finding the books that they needed is not easy; 2. Following the increasing number of people inside library, the bookshelves would be quite chaotic, which is really difficult to manage. </p>

It is also the reason that causes bookshelves are hard to arrange.</p>

                <p>In the end, I interviewed 3 borrowers and 3 library staffs.

They said that they don't have any premissions to answer my question.Therefore, I only get 3 availible feedback. Through the interview, borrowers mentioned that they feel difficult to find the positions of the books that they look for. Sometime, when they come library to borrow books, staffs tell them the books they want is already booked. Meanwhile 2 borrowers also mentioned that they live far away from library, even though they can order books online, it is inconvenient for them to pick up. 
          <br>
          <br> Even though the data from library staffs is difficult to get, I still have interviewed 3 library staffs. They mention that sometime the bookshelves could be really messy, they feel difficult to put the books to the right place. Moreover, they think staffs and students put the books in the wrong place may be the main reason for why bookshelves are messy. At the meantime, when I asked them how do they think about using drones in the library to help them to manage bookshelves, all of them said that it is not possible to use the drone inside library, it is really easy to hurt people.</p>

         I gather all of my key findings and discuss with Aidan. Then we decided to create at the least 3 concepts that should satisfy the three aims, helping users find the actual positions of the books, delivering books to users and help staffs to manage bookshelves.<br>

All of these ideas all came from users' perspectives. Gathering all of the users' needs, I generated our main target that is using APP to interact with drones to deliver books from library to borrowers, and library staffs can use this APP to help them to manage library. </p>

                <p>The second concept is called “pigeon”, students can use this APP to borrow books from library, and the drones will deliver the books to the users’ location. When the due day of return comes, the App will remind the user and send a drone to pick up and return the books. The one interesting thing is so many people asked me why this App named “Pigeon”? Actually, the reason for that is in the ancient time, people train the pigeons to deliver letters, when drones deliver books, it looks like pigeon, so I named this concept Pigeon.</p>

So, I eliminated the first concept, and selected “Pigeon” and “iTrolley”.  </p>

                <p>In the week 9, I started to sketch the storyboards for the two concepts. Because my group members are bad at sketch, I had to do all of sketch works. To find out a perfect way to show my ideas, I have sketched them many times. Because I sketched them on the papers, if I did a little bit wrong, which means I need to re-sketch them again. In the end, after I made 2 iterations, the final storyboards were generated. The story of iTrolley is that: A library staff wants to return many books back to bookshelves. He just knows these books from this level. Then, he uses the App iTrolley to scan the QR codes of books and put them into the automatic trolley, and the trolley will lead the staff to the book’s position follow the list order from App. When the trolley arrives at the right position, the book will be popped-up and the App will show the actual position of the book in the shelf, and the staff just needs to put the book to that position.  </p>

                <p>The story for “Pigeon” is that: A student lives far away from library, but he wants to borrow books. Then he opens an App “Pigeon” and order the books from the App. The library staff receives his order and use a drone to delivery the book. Just several minutes, the drone arrives with the book he ordered. A week after, the App reminds the student to return the book and library will send a drone to pick up the order. When the drone arrives, student just need follow the prompt on the App to put the book back to the drone.  </p>

                <p>When I had finished storyboard drawing, I jumped into make low-fidelity prototype. I asked Aidan to make one prototype for Pigeon, and I made 2 prototypes. One for Pigeon, one for iTrolley. Actually, I have 2 iterations of Pigeon, because when I finished the first one, I tested it with several participants, all of them don’t like the interface, therefore, I improved the structure and generated the iteration 2. When I finished these prototypes, I went to the usability testing and evaluation immediately. I tested the iTrolley with 4 target peoples, however, I actually find 8 librarian staffs, only 4 of them were willing to accept my testing. All of them told me this app can help them to reduce work pressure, but still need to be improved, such as there isn’t stop button or what is the next when the trolley finished its works. Then, I tested the Pigeon with 10 target participants. Actually, some of them mentioned that the interface is not clear, but that just is wireframe which is different with hi-fidelity prototype. So I think the reason for they think the interface is not clear may be due to that it just is hand-sketch wireframe prototype which may be seemed little bit confusing.  </p>

                <p>In this week, I created the evaluation plan for my group, our aim is that finding at the least 10 target people to test the all prototypes. We need to ask them to achieve a basic user flow, and we need to collect their feedback to refine our project in next assessment. In the end, I made a design matrix to decide which concept should we choose to continue. The “Pigeon 1.0” got the lowest mark, because participants mentioned the Pigeon 1.0 lacks functions and some buttons there are easily cause misleading. Therefore, “Pigeon 1.0” was eliminated. The interesting thing is the “Pigeon 2.0” and “iTrolley” got the same mark, however, we gave up “iTrolley”. Honest speaking, even though “ iTrolley” got same mark as “Pigeon 2.0”, it is really difficult to find the target participants who are willing to help us to test. I had found at the least 8 library staffs in fisher, I just got 2 useful feedbacks.   </p>

                <p>Depending on the users ‘feedbacks, I made the mid-hi-fidelity wireframes by sketch. It was harder than I thought, I had spent a lot of time on making it looks adorable. Especially, the prompt part, in the Low-Fi texting many of them think the prompt pages are easy to cause misleading, Therefore, I redesign the all part, I deleted the all prompt page. When I finished it and put it on my report, I tested it with several participants immediately. The result is that, all of them said that comparing with the low-fidelity prototype, the wireframe is improved a lot. But they told me that the reminder is not obvious enough, so I will improve that in hi-fidelity prototype.  </p>

                <p>In this week, I created the HiFi prototype depending on the feedback of the assessment2. Comparing with last prototype, the obvious change is that it has better interface and intuative visual design. I tested it with 3 participants, all of them satisfy  new prototype. However, they also mentioned that they can't cancel the order in the half way. And they said that the "add to list" button and the heart button are easy to cause misleading.   </p>

                <p> According to the participants' feedbacks, I improved the prototype again. I delected some buttons that may make users confused. Moreover, I delected the Face ID, because 1 participant asked me that if the face id scan failed, what is the solution for that. And the biggest change is that I moved the all prompts to the system reminder, which will make the screen really clear. After the refine, all participants admitted that the pigeon now is completed functioning. </p>
